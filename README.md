# StarWarsApi
Coding Project for CodeTheDream

This project provides the basic instructions for creating a project that will demonstrate these competencies by using the Star Wars API and creating a page that allows a user to navigate around the data provided from that api.

Created a basic webpage displaying items from the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/) .

The basic requirements include: Creating the HTML for the page Styling the elements on the page using CSS Retrieving the data to display on the page using JavaScript to fetch the data from the Star Wars API as needed Providing a README file that includes the instructions for running the webpage T he content that you decide to use from the api, as well as the way it is displayed, is up to you however at a minimum it should include the following: Display the data for at least 2 of the models in the API (we suggest starting with people and films) Provide a way for the user to navigate from each modelâ€™s page to the other models that are displayed The simplest version of this would allow going from a person to the films they are in and from a film to the characters in that film Issue new GET requests for the linked data to display in the linked pages The project should be created as a repository in GitHub and a link to the repository should be submitted for assessment in the assessment form.

The project was built to create Async/Await with Starwars API using Vanilla Javascript and Bootstrap
